# What we will have and what we should reach
### we will have simple form with login password (login)
* login just serializing
* password base64 encoding and serializing and displaying

### we will need to implement additional fields in new additional form (register)
* repeat password base64 encoding displaying
* name converted to full name
* surname converted to full name
* use SOLID approach to reach results
